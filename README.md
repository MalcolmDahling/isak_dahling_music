<h2>Project idea summary</h2>
<p>My project was to create a website for my brother to show off his music to other artists and record labels. I decided to use a CMS to make it as easy as possible to update content. The website is designed to automatically update when a new song or news article is added.

I followed the plan with issues I had created on Trello and checked them off pretty quickly, but during the project new issues were often added. There were some parts I got stuck on like the “zoom” animations and sending emails from the email form but I eventually solved the problems after a lot of googling.

Overall, I’m very happy with the results and other people find my work impressive. This was the most fun project I’ve done during my time in school.</p>
