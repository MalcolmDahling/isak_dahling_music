<h2>Project idea summary</h2>
<p>My project was to create a website for my brother to show off his music to other artists and record labels. I decided to use a CMS to make it as easy as possible to update content. The website is designed to automatically update when a new song or news article is added.

I followed the plan with issues I had created on Trello and checked them off pretty quickly, but during the project new issues were often added. There were some parts I got stuck on like the “zoom” animations and sending emails from the email form but I eventually solved the problems after a lot of googling.

Overall, I’m very happy with the results and other people find my work impressive. This was the most fun project I’ve done during my time in school.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<strong>Describe your target audience and their interest in your project.</strong>

<p>The target audience are other artists and record labels and this website will make it easy for them to listen to my brothers music and contact him about deals and collaborations.</p>

<strong>Describe why you came up with the idea and why it was relevant for your target audience.</strong>

<p>My brother wanted a website and my other idea of creating a chess AI website seemed too difficult to achieve in 6 weeks.

It is relevant because all my brothers work is now collected in a single location which eliminates searching over many different platforms. It also contains an email form which makes it easier to contact him.</p>

<strong>Describe what kind of value your project brought.</strong>

<p>It brought value to my brother because he has something nice to show off. It brought value to me because I have something to show future employers. It brought value to fans of my brother’s music because they can now listen to all his songs from one place. It brought value to other artists and record labels because they can now listen to his music and contact him through the email form.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

  <strong>Summarize the results of your 6-week project.</strong>

  </br>

  <strong>Results from user stories</strong></br>
  I tried to make the website fit all the user stories so that the website will be appropriate for all audiences. I believe that I did just that and I am happy with my work.

  <strong>Activity and time plan</strong>
  
  </br>
  
  <strong>Summarize your activity and time plan. How did you work? Did it go according to plan? Hiccups?</strong>
  </br>
  I was way ahead of schedule from the start until the end, so I had lots of time to improve and change things. I got stuck a few times but 10 hours of googling later I managed to solve it.
